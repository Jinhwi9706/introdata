Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a telecom customer will churn (leave the company) or not. Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and build a predictive model.

# Contents

Data Importing: Load the telecom customer dataset.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing or incorrect data to prepare it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand patterns in the data.

Feature Engineering: Select and preprocess features for the machine learning model.

Model Building: Train and evaluate a machine learning model to predict churn.

# File Structure

telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook for this project.

requirements.txt: A list of Python packages needed.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

# Goals
This project helps in:

Learning basic data science workflows.

Understanding and working with real-world datasets.

Applying data cleaning, visualization, and analysis techniques.

Building a predictive model to classify customers as likely to churn or not.

Providing actionable insights to reduce customer churn.
